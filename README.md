### Bank Loan Analysis Project using SQL and Power BI

In this project, I developed a comprehensive analysis system for bank loans utilizing SQL for data management and Power BI for visualization. The primary goal was to provide insightful analytics on loan applications, funded amount, and received amount, average interest rate and average DTI (Debt to Income).

Project Highlights:

- Data Management with SQL: I used SQL to clean and organize the bank loan data, learning how to write basic queries to extract relevant information.
- Basic Dashboards in Power BI: Created simple, yet effective dashboards in Power BI to visualize loan data, including charts and graphs.
- Customer Analysis: Conducted a basic analysis of customer data to identify trends based on criteria like loan type, funded amounts and repayment status.
- Introductory Risk Assessment: Implemented a straightforward risk assessment to visualize potential loan defaults, helping to identify high-risk loans.
- Tracking Loan Performance: Developed simple visualizations to track loan performance over time, providing a clear picture of trends and patterns.

This project was a great learning experience, helping me build foundational skills in data analysis and visualization, and demonstrating how to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
